# H1
## H2

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-is style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------




Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emephasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~




1. First ordered list item
2. Another item

...To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing $

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don;t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
